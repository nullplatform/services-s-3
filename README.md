# AWS S3 Service

Nullplatform **dependency service** that provisions and manages an Amazon S3 bucket on AWS. Each application link creates a dedicated IAM user + access key with scoped S3 permissions, so apps authenticate with standard AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).

The service lives under [`aws-s3-bucket/`](./aws-s3-bucket) to keep the repo open for future S3-related services.

## What It Does

- Provisions an S3 bucket via OpenTofu (versioning, server-side encryption, public access block)
- Creates a dedicated IAM user per link with an inline policy scoped to the bucket (and optional path prefix)
- Exposes `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` per link (each linked app gets its own IAM user) plus `BUCKET_NAME` / `BUCKET_ARN` / `BUCKET_REGION` from the service itself
- Stores per-instance OpenTofu state in a dedicated bucket (`np-service-<SERVICE_ID>`) with native S3 locking (`use_lockfile=true`)

## Service Configuration Parameters

Exposed in the nullplatform UI when creating/updating the service:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Allowed Values | Editable After Create |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bucket_name_suffix` | string | — | lowercase alphanumeric + `-`, 3–40 chars | No |
| `versioning` | bool | `true` | | Yes |
| `encryption` | string | `AES256` | `AES256`, `aws:kms` | Yes |
| `public_access_block` | bool | `true` | | Yes |
| `force_destroy` | bool | `false` | | Yes |

**Bucket naming**: `np-<sanitized-service-name>-<bucket_name_suffix>` (computed once on first create, then persisted — immutable to prevent accidental replacement on service rename).

## Link Parameters (`connect`)

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `access_level` | enum | `read-write` | `read`, `write`, `read-write` |
| `path_prefix` | string | `""` | Scope IAM permissions to a key prefix (empty = full bucket) |

## Service Attributes (post-create, exported as env vars)

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `bucket_name` | S3 bucket name |
| `bucket_arn` | S3 bucket ARN |
| `bucket_region` | AWS region |

## Link Attributes (per link, exported as env vars)

Only credentials are exposed at the link level — bucket identity (name / ARN / region) comes from the service attributes above to avoid duplicate env vars in linked apps.

| Attribute | Env Var Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `aws_access_key_id` | plain | IAM user access key ID |
| `aws_secret_access_key` | secret | IAM user secret access key |

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | Service created | Creates bucket, versioning, encryption, public access block |
| `update` | Service updated | Re-applies terraform with updated attributes |
| `delete` | Service deleted | Destroys bucket (needs `force_destroy=true` if non-empty) and tfstate bucket |
| `link` | Application linked | Creates IAM user + access key scoped to the bucket and access level |
| `link-update` | Link updated | In-place update of the IAM user policy (access_level or path_prefix changes). Credentials are preserved. |
| `unlink` | Application unlinked | Destroys the IAM user and access key |

## Requirements

### nullplatform prerequisites

- An account-level provider exposing `account.region`

### AWS IAM permissions (for the agent role)

The agent executing this service needs the IAM policies defined in [`aws-s3-bucket/requirements/main.tf`](./aws-s3-bucket/requirements/main.tf):

- S3 bucket management (`s3:CreateBucket`, `s3:PutBucketVersioning`, etc.) over `*`
- IAM user management (`iam:CreateUser`, `iam:CreateAccessKey`, `iam:PutUserPolicy`, etc.) over `arn:aws:iam::*:user/np-s3-*` (or `*` for simpler scope)
- S3 tfstate management over `arn:aws:s3:::np-service-*`

### Runtime dependencies

- **OpenTofu 1.11.6** — auto-downloaded to `/tmp/np-tofu-bin/` if not in `PATH`. Version 1.10+ is required for native S3 state locking (`use_lockfile=true`), which avoids the need for a DynamoDB lock table.
- AWS CLI
- `jq`

## How to register this service in nullplatform

Use the [`nullplatform/service_definition`](https://github.com/nullplatform/tofu-modules/tree/main/nullplatform/service_definition) and [`nullplatform/service_definition_agent_association`](https://github.com/nullplatform/tofu-modules/tree/main/nullplatform/service_definition_agent_association) modules. Example:

```hcl
module "service_definition_aws_s3_bucket" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/nullplatform/tofu-modules.git//nullplatform/service_definition?ref=v1.51.0"
  nrn    = var.nrn

  git_provider      = "github"
  repository_org    = "nullplatform"
  repository_name   = "services-s-3"
  repository_branch = "main"
  service_path      = "aws-s3-bucket"

  service_name = "AWS S3 Bucket"
}

module "service_definition_channel_association_aws_s3_bucket" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/nullplatform/tofu-modules.git//nullplatform/service_definition_agent_association?ref=v1.51.0"

  nrn                          = var.nrn
  api_key                      = module.service_notification_api_key.api_key
  tags_selectors               = var.tags_selectors
  service_specification_slug   = module.service_definition_aws_s3_bucket.service_specification_slug
  repository_service_spec_repo = "nullplatform/services-s-3"
  service_path                 = "aws-s3-bucket"
}
```

## Important considerations

### Data loss on delete

Deleting the service destroys the bucket. If `force_destroy=false` (default) and the bucket is non-empty, OpenTofu refuses to destroy. Set `force_destroy=true` before deleting if you want the agent to wipe objects.

### Access keys are long-lived

Links use static IAM access keys. Rotate by re-creating the link or manually in the AWS console if needed.

### Bucket name global uniqueness

S3 bucket names are globally unique across all AWS accounts. The combination `np-<service-name>-<bucket_name_suffix>` must be globally unique.

### State locking

OpenTofu uses native S3 lockfile (`use_lockfile=true`). Concurrent `apply` runs are serialized — the second one waits for the lock and then sees the up-to-date state, producing idempotent behavior on retries.
